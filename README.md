# LoRa based inter UAV communication

INAV-Radar is an addition to the [INAV](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav) flight control software, it relays information about UAVs in the area to the flight controller for display on the OSD. INAV-Radar does this by using [LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) radio to broadcast position, altitude, speed and plane name. It also listens for other UAVs so INAV OSD  can display this information as a radar style map.

## Hardware

Current development is done using these cheap ESP32 LoRa modules.

There are different variants for 433MHz and 868/915MHz:

[Banggood: ESP32 Lora 868/915MHz (2 Pcs)](https://www.banggood.com/de/2Pcs-Wemos-TTGO-LORA32-868915Mhz-ESP32-LoRa-OLED-0_96-Inch-Blue-Display-p-1239769.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN)

[Banggood: ESP32 Lora 433MHz](https://www.banggood.com/de/Wemos-TTGO-LORA-SX1278-ESP32-0_96OLED-16-Mt-Bytes-128-Mt-bit-433Mhz-For-Arduino-p-1205930.html?rmmds=search&cur_warehouse=CN)

Other variants (e.g. Heltec) or without OLED display and different antenna connectors should also work.

Also please keep track of your countries regulations regarding radio transmissions.

## Development

Everything here is WORK IN PROGRESS!

The software is based on two components:
- ESP32 LoRa part is found in this repo.
It's developed using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) plugin for [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor.
- INAV OSD part repo is found [here](https://github.com/mistyk/inavRC2).
It's a fork from the INAV repo and instructions how to build can be found [here](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/development/Building%20in%20Docker.md).

INAV-Radar is a experimental firmware based on INAV and is currently no part of the INAV flight control software. INAV repo can be found [here](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav).

## Testing

For testing there is no need to install Atom and PlatformIO, just use the [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) for flashing.

Your system needs the driver for the USB UART bridge:
[Windows+MacOS](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
 or [Alternative MacOS](https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver)

Also you will need [Python 3.4 or newer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system.

Be sure to check 'Add Python to PATH':
![Python Setup](https://github.com/mistyk/inavradar-ESP32/raw/master/docs/python.png)


The latest stable esptool.py release can be installed via pip in your command prompt:

Windows:
```
c:\> pip install esptool
```

MacOS:
```
$ pip3 install esptool
```

Download the air-to-air test firmware from the [releases page](https://github.com/mistyk/inavradar-ESP32/releases)
and extract it. Run this command to flash it onto your ESP32 Lora module (Windows and MacOS):

You may change the --port to match your operating system. If you are using Windows check the [device manager](https://github.com/mistyk/inavradar-ESP32/raw/master/docs/devManager.PNG).

Windows:
```
c:\> cd (your air-to-air directory here)
c:\> esptool.py --port COM11 write_flash -z --flash_mode dio 0x1000 bootloader_dio_40m.bin 0x8000 default.bin 0xe000 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 firmware.bin 0x291000 fs.bin
```

MacOS:
```
$ cd (your air-to-air directory here)
$ esptool.py --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART write_flash -z --flash_mode dio 0x1000 bootloader_dio_40m.bin 0x8000 default.bin 0xe000 boot_app0.bin 0x10000 firmware.bin 0x291000 fs.bin

```

The output should look something like this:
![Windows CMD output](https://github.com/mistyk/inavradar-ESP32/raw/master/docs/cmd.PNG)

## Commands

After the firmware is flashed on the devices you should see 'No FC' (or the name of the UAV) on the opposing display.
If only the bottom line with TX and RX is showing, something is not working correctly, please open a serial terminal (Windows e.g. [PuTTy](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)). Reset the device connected to the terminal and send us a copy of the output.

Via USB serial you get a small CLI with debug output.

Also there are some commands:

```
================= Commands =================
status                  - Show whats going on
help                    - List all commands
config                  - List all settings
config loraFreq n       - Set frequency in Hz (e.g. n = 433000000)
config loraBandwidth n  - Set bandwidth in Hz (e.g. n = 250000)
config loraSpread n     - Set SF (e.g. n = 10)
config uavtimeout n     - Set UAV timeout in sec (e.g. n = 10)
config fctimeout n      - Set FC timeout in sec (e.g. n = 5)
config debuglat n       - Set debug GPS lat * 10000000 (e.g. n = 501004900)
config debuglon n       - Set debug GPS lon * 10000000 (e.g. n = 87632280)
reboot                  - Reset MCU and radio
gpspos                  - Show last GPS position
debug                   - Toggle debug output
localfakeplanes         - Send fake plane to FC
lfp                     - Send fake plane to FC
radiofakeplanes         - Send fake plane via radio
rfp                     - Send fake plane via radio
movefakeplanes          - Move fake plane
mfp                     - Move fake plane
```

Attention !!! On Windows with Putty you must use [CRTL]-[J] instead of the [ENTER] key.

## Wireing

A [testing version](https://github.com/mistyk/inavradar-ESP32/releases) of INAV needs to be installed on your FC.
To connect the ESP32 to the FC:
- wire up +5V and GND
- TX from FC to ESP RX pin 17
- RX from FC to ESP TX pin 23

Just activate MSP con the corrosponding UART, the speed is 115200.

Thanks for testing! üòÑ üëç
